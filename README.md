# Cop or Not

![Github licence](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description 
The idea behind this app is to allow the user to find NFT's they like in a comparison with another NFT.  The idea was derived from dating sites but the special twist we included was to have a "Head to Head" matchup with the NFT's.  The future goal is to get this implemented and after choosing which you like the price tag would show up on each picture to see how "Popular" it is based on price.
